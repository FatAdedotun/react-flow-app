# React Flow App

This is me getting my hands on one of the numerous applications of ReactJs.
I implemented some basic node representation in this repo.
After getting familiar with the docs and examples on the ReactFlow website (I created CentralFlow components), then, I created another component (FunctionalFlow).
The FunctionalFlow component has some basic functionality implemented in it. It can removeElements and addEdges on the browser.
